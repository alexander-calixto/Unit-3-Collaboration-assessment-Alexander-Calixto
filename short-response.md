# Short response questions
### 1. If i am collaborating with a classmate the first thing we need to do is make a branch. The reason we do this is so we dont ruin main by doing something inccorectly.
### 2. Developers use beranches to work outside of main, usually used when collaborating so they dont break anything.
### 3. Git is a distributed version control system that allows us to interact with other repo's. Github is a cloud based service that allows you to save your code. Git and github work together because git allows you to work on the repos and then github allows you to save that code.
### 4. The thing wrong with the command sequence is that they did `git commit -m""` first instead of `git add .`. The correct squence would be:



```
git add .
git commit -m "saving work"
git push
```
